# Battleship

A throwback game(well maybe not so throwback, they have all kinds of battleship reincarnations these days, but you get my point.) to times once past. It's battleship. The best game for a loner programmer, seeing as you can play against the computer... again... and again. Seek destruction, seek power, seek vengeance. Yes, this game will let you stare into the abyss, and guess what, the abyss will stare back with a torpedo to the face.
